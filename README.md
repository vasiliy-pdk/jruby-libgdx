#### Tried to make an executable jar file with warble. The file is generated, but I can't run it: 

```
vasyl@xps956:~/code/jruby-libgdx$ warble
No executable matching config.jar_name found, using bin/main
rm -f jruby-libgdx.jar
Creating jruby-libgdx.jar
vasyl@xps956:~/code/jruby-libgdx$ java -jar jruby-libgdx.jar 
AL lib: (EE) alc_cleanup: 1 device not closed
